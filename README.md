I recently got to know about GitHub Pages and see it as an excellent opportunity to revive my frontend development skills and create an online CV.

	About me
</h3>
<div align="left">
I am someone whose well-being depends on having opportunities to learn. I am a fast-learning autodidact, I like to teach myself new (natural) languages as well as new instruments. I consider myself a lifelong learner, autodidact, artist and musician. I'm a polyglot with 5 usable languages, some I merely understand and some that could be usable fairly fast if I gave them some atttention.<br>
Currently I work as a Lenovo service technician, but I am exploring my options regarding a change to being a software developer. I have 10+ years of experience with unix-like systems with a focus on Arch Linux, Debian and OS X.<br>

Here is a list of things I will (re)explore, though not necessarily in this repository.<br>

Things I already worked or played with:
<ul>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Go</li>
	<li>C</li>
	<li>C++</li>
	<li>NetBSD and it's config files</li>
	<li>Arduino</li>
	<li>LOLCode</li>
	<li>COBOL</li>
</ul>
Non-exhaustive list of things I am yet to touch:
<ul>
	<li>Gentoo and it's config files</li>
	<li>Haskell</li>
</ul>
